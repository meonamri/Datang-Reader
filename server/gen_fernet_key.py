"""Generate a Fernet key for IDME_ENCRYPTION_KEY.

A Fernet key is 32 random bytes, base64-encoded (a 44-char string ending in '=').
The IDME module uses it to encrypt teacher portal credentials at rest in the DB.

Generate it ONCE and keep it safe:
  - If you change/lose it, already-stored teacher credentials can't be decrypted.
  - Treat it like a password; never commit it to git.

Run (Windows, using the test venv that already has `cryptography`):
    .\.venv-idme\Scripts\python.exe gen_fernet_key.py

Then copy the printed line into your .env as:
    IDME_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<the key>
